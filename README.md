Short Description<br>
A stealth game where the main character must avoid infected monsters while hacking their mind to prevent themselves from being infected. They must sneak through a spaceship and gather ingredients to cure infected crewmates.

<b>Concept Art</b> <br>

Concept art for the player character <br>
Nailing the player character concept was key, considering we wanted to base the style of the rest of our game around the energy the player gave off. Several concepts were created before we decided on a particular design. <br>

We decided that we liked the business suit theme, and further iterated upon that concept. <br>

We were also interested in exploring the TV head theme further, synthesizing multiple things we liked from different concepts throughout the process. <br>

Ultimately, we liked the theme of an office infected by a zombie-like plague that mutates the NPCs and player characters. We were especially drawn to the concept of a black-and-white world, where the infection would appear in bombastic, saturated rainbow tones. The main character is a robot who staves off her infection by solving puzzles to temporarily "cure" the virus. We imagined her having multiple appearances depending on her infection level, where splotches of color would gradually take her over. <br>

With these concepts, we explored multiple colorways and how they would look at various infected states. <br>

We also were planning to incorporate a dialogue system with visual novel-like stills. The story of the game would have been be told through these dialogue segments. However, due to time and scope constraints, we weren't fully able to incorporate this aspect. Nonetheless, we have quite a bit of concept art revolving around NPCs. <br>

Our most important NPC was going to be the "tutorial giver", who at the time didn't have a name. They were planned to be a talking head in the corner of the screen. The plot twist at the end of the story was that the person who had been guiding the player through their journey was already infected, and was quite literally a talking head. The infection would consume them and the boss battle would begin. Since this character was so key to the story, we spent time establishing the look and feel of this character.<br>

After deciding on one design, we established how we would've wanted her to look during dialogue sections. Her big reveal would have had her swiveling around on a stool to reveal that she is only a head. <br>

There were initially plans for there to be three additional enemies outside of the boss battle, but we scoped that back to two. <br>

The first enemy would be Morris, a man who is combined with his pet bird Dewberry due to the infection. This concept would have been clearer if we had had the time to create visual novel stills, as he would be seen by the player cured with his pet bird companion. <br>

The second enemy is Charlotte, combined with a bee she was attempting to kill moments before her infection. Her concept was all about vision and watching. She was also intended to the the "tutorial giver" Vanessa's secretary. <br>

We also had concept art for the environment and HUD elements. <br>

These were concepts for our puzzle game that players would have to solve as they increasingly got infected.<br>

Here, we explored what the office environment the player would be exploring would look like. This was key to creating the tilemap. <br>

We also did a quick concept of our HUD. <br>

<b>Final Assets</b><br>
Here's a quick look at all of the final assets that made it into the game. <br>

First, we have our sprite sheet. I spent over 10 hours on this, after which I severely scoped back future sprite sheets. This sprite sheet has three states; normal, lightly infected and heavily infected. <br>

Then, we have our enemy sprite sheets. Each has rather simple animations for the sake of time. <br>

This was our tilemap. We kept it simple to emphasize our more detailed character and enemy sprites. <br>

We also had sprite sheets for moving security cameras. <br>

Vanessa also has a small sprite sheet for her talking animations. <br>

All of our HUD elements were made in separate parts to work with progress bar functionality. Sharing those individual assets would make little sense visually. <br>

That's all the artwork we did for this game! <br>
